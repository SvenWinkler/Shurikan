 * Added item for discussion. Should it be an item for the input queue
 * or is it always a backlog item because of every queue will be a product backlog.
 *
 * Sounds good to me to have a product backlog, because we develop products.
 * But an input queue could chain products together. If I have an input queue, what about an output queue?
